# Riot API Challenge
My entry for the Riot Games API Challenge 2018. There's not a whole lot here right now and I have to be real careful as what I push so I don't accidentally give away my API key. That thought is *terrifying*.

If anybody is looking to write their project using HTML/CSS/JS/PHP, this will be a pretty good place to look as reference eventually. I aim to have all the setup for this project (all the endpoints I want accessible) finished by 12/30/18. If you have any questions as to how or why I did certain things, feel free to reach out to me on Discord via the RiotAPIDevCommunity server. Look for **Sloth#9774** and shoot me a message.
